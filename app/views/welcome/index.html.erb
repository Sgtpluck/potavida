          <h2>Lowering the Cost of Access to Safe Water</h2>
          <p>
            Despite $30B spent annually on water and sanitation development projects, 700 million people do not have access to clean water. People’s needs are not met by local infrastructure and existing household level disinfection methods are too expensive. Disaster relief also reveals unmet need for safe water: $9B has been spent on disaster relief in Haiti, yet over 700,000 people have been infected with Cholera, a waterborne disease, and over 9,000 people have died. The NGOs and governments that respond to these disasters need a lower cost method of disinfecting water reliably that does not rely upon consistent supply chains. 
          <br><br>
            We provide a lower cost of safe water over the product lifetime than any competing point-of-use technology. Requiring only a single distribution, our purifier not only reduces costs, but also avoids dependence on supply chains for ongoing access to safe water.</p>

            <h2>Enabling Efficient Use of Resources</h2>
            <p>
            NGOs and governments need better data to optimize their choice between existing options. Today they rely upon in-person surveys to collect information on the use of water purification systems. Surveying a household takes 20 to 30 minutes of staff time per household, and the resulting self-reported data suffers from yeah-saying bias. These institutions need a faster way to collect more accurate data so they can reach more people more efficiently.
            <br><br>
            Our wireless data transfer between water purifiers and a smartphone-based capture device reduces data collection time and improves accuracy, enabling program evaluation at a lower cost. We make it possible for NGOs and governments to reach more people with existing funds.

        <hr>
        <br>
        <div class="col-lg-offset-1 col-lg-10">
          <p>Until now, there has not been a reliable way to determine when solar disinfection has actually been achieved. PotaVida has developed a simple UV and temperature monitor that visually indicates to users when water disinfection is underway, and when water is safe to drink. Users can press a button to query disinfection status at any point. The electronic monitor stores usage data, which can then be wirelessly transmitted to a handheld smartphone-based device for upload to an online database along with GPS position. 
            <br><br>
          PotaVida’s current purifier design is a 3L water bag with an integrated solar disinfection monitor and data logger. The solar disinfection monitor tracks cumulative exposure to sunlight and uses LEDs to indicate when sufficient exposure has been reached to inactivate pathogens in the water. Users can simply fill the bag with water, place it in the sun, push a button, and wait for the LED indicator to indicate that the water is safe.
          <br>
          PotaVida make it as easy as one, two, three:
            <ol>
              <li>Fill the PotaVida purifier with clear water, and place it in the sun.</li>
              <li>Press start button.</li>
              <li> Look at the lights. Red light = in progress, and green light = safe to drink.</li>

          <hr>
            <p>Solar disinfection is a process recommended by the World Health Organization which uses the UV in sunlight to inactive pathogens in water. Both bacteria and viruses are inactivated by solar disinfection. The process takes a few hours, depending on weather, water clarity, and the UV transparency of the container. In addition, temperatures above 45oC increase the speed at which pathogens are destroyed. When combined with these increased temperatures, amoebeas, cysts, and spores are also destroyed by solar disinfection.
              <br><br>
            Depending on conditions, users can complete as many as 3 disinfection cycles daily, resulting in 9L or more of safe water produced per day. We plan to increase the current 3L bag capacity to 5-6L, enabling up to 18L of water disinfection per day.  The bag-based design is foldable and stackable for shipping efficiency. Because the purifiers use no consumables and will operate for several years, the cost per unit volume of safe water over the lifetime of the device is lower than any competing point-of-use water disinfection technology.

            <p>Q: What plastic bottles can be used? Don't dangerous chemicals leach from plastics, especially when left in the sun?</p>

            <p>A: Thin-walled polyethylene terephthalate, labeled PET or PETE in the US, can be safely used for SODIS. These are marked with the "1" recycling symbol, shown below. Glass bottles can be used, but only if the glass is known to be free of UV-blocking additives, so is not usually recommended.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Valid concerns about hazardous chemicals leaching from PET bottles left in the sun have been addressed by scientific studies. Leached organic compounds amount to less than 10% of the safe amount for drinking water as defined by the WHO, and no other chemicals are leached.    <%= link_to 'More information', "http://www.sodis.ch/news_documents/deha_dehp_indien.pdf" %></p>

            <p>Q: How large a problem is contaminated drinking water?</p>

            <p>A: “The sheer scale of dirty water means more people now die from contaminated and polluted water than from all forms of violence including wars,” the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) said. This includes 2.2 million people whose deaths are attributed to diarrhea, mostly from dirty water, and 1.8 million children aged under five who succumb to water-borne diseases. This equates to one infant every 20 seconds. <em>Christian Science Monitor (3/22/2010)</em></p>

            <p>Preventable deaths from diarrheal diseases account for 1.4 million or 18% of all deaths in children under five per year. <em>WHO (2010)</em></p>

            <p>Q: How effective is SODIS at solving this problem?</p>

            <p>A: With proper use of SODIS, the “risk of diarrhea was reduced by 40%”. <em>Rose, A., et al. (2006). Solar disinfection of water for diarrhoeal prevention in southern India. Archives of Disease in Children, 91, 139-141.</em></p>

            <p>Q: How much does SODIS cost compared to other water treatments?</p>

            <p>A: 
            <%= image_tag('sodiscost.png') %>Annual cost comparison of different interventions to improve water quality. <em>Reproduced from Casen et. al. 2007</em></p>
            
            <p>Q: How does solar disinfection (SODIS) work?</p>

            <p>A: Three effects of solar radiation kill or deactivate dysentery-causing organisms:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Ultraviolet light interferes directly with the metabolism and destroys cell structures of bacteria.</li>
                <li>Ultraviolet light reacts with oxygen dissolved in the water and produces highly reactive forms of oxygen (oxygen free radicals and hydrogen peroxides), that are believed to also damage pathogens.</li>
                <li>Cumulative solar energy (including the infrared radiation component) heats the water. If the water temperatures rises above 50°C, the disinfection process is three times faster.
                </li>
              </ol>

            <p>Q: How will the PotaVida indicator work?</p>

            <p>A: ﻿﻿Our indicator measures the exposure of the water to solar irradiation. It will differentiate between darkness, partial sun, and full sun, and indicate progress according to the SODIS guidelines for sufficient expose.</p>

            <p>The SODIS indicator could be configured to wait for exactly the required exposure, but instead implements the guidelines so that it will serve as a training tool. This way, people can learn and have confidence in SODIS without having to use an indicator every time.</p>
